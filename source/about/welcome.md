# Welcome from the CEO

Hi there!

I am so happy you are here. As the founder and CEO of Unity Web Agency, it is my personal goal to make this company a place where people love to work.

Our mission at Unity Web Agency is to make the internet radically inclusive, one website at a time. That's what drives us to get out of bed in the morning and show up to work as our best selves.

Working at Unity is a little different than working at other businesses:

- First, our business runs a bit more like a nonprofit. We are united around our mission, truly serve our community, and make the world a better place. That's why we are a Certified B Corporation.
- Second, our team is our magic ingredient. We are talented individuals with a shared passion for serving the greater good. Everybody is valued, respected, and critical in making our work a success.
- Third, our clients make our world go round! We love working with nonprofits and businesses who are working to improve the lives of people in their community.

I am truly grateful that you are a part of our team. Thank you for sharing your talents with us and for being a part of our journey!

Warmly,
