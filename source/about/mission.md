# Mission

Our mission is to make the internet radically inclusive by creating accessible and sustainable websites that follow WCAG standards with a minimal environmental impact.

People with disabilities are a historically marginalized group of internet users. We create websites that are designed from the beginning to provide equal access to all people regardless of (dis)ability.

Additionally, the internet as a whole produces roughly the same emissions as global aviation travel. We build websites in such a way as to improve their energy efficiency and host websites using green energy sources.

## Our Core Values

We live and breathe our core values of **Embrace Differences**, **Lead with Love**, **Create with Curiosity**, and **Invest in the Greater Good**.

The following lists include examples of mindsets, behaviors, and actions that illustrate what each of the core values means to us.


### Embrace Differences
- Don't judge people by their covers. How they look and speak, their education, their beliefs, and their background/experiences is all part of what makes people unique and interesting.
- Welcome individuals where they are emotionally, physically, spiritually.
- Acknowledge and value differences of thoughts, values, ways of thining/doing (Kolbe), perspectives, etc in others and ourselves.
- Be open and flexible to change and new ways of thinking/doing.
- Design and develop solutions which accommodate people's various differences.

### Lead with Love
- Be empathetic, caring, and respectful towards everyone (team, clients, vendors, the public).
- Own your seat (responsibilities, expertise, etc) and move towards individual and collective leadership, regardless of your position on the team.
- Show initiative by stepping up to do what is necessary, even without being asked.
- Follow when needed and step aside for others to succeed.
- Balance impact on individuals, the team, and community when making decisions.

### Create with Curiosity
- Be inquisitive &mdash; explore, research, learn, listen, seek to understand) &mdash; without presumption.
- Improvise and push the boundaries of what's been done before.
- Approach challenges with a "beginner's mind" to see things from a new perspective..
- Keep and eye out for creative improvement opportunities even if they fall outside of our standard process.
- Trust yourself

### Invest in the Greater Good
- Proactively consider the costs and benefits of our options today, to make the best possible choice for the most long-term, sustainable positive impact for as many stakeholders as possible.
- Give back to our community through service opportunities and donations.
- Enable and encourage confidence, empowerment, and self-efficacy.
