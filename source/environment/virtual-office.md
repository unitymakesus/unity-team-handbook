# Virtual Office Stewardship Policy

It is the policy of Unity Web Agency to:

- Encourage all team members and contractors to follow best environmental practices in their home offices.
- Promote energy conservation by maximizing the use of natural light, using energy-efficient lights such as LEDs, using Energy Star printers, and ensuring that all lights are turned off when not in use.
- Promote water conservation by encouraging the use of low-flow toilets and water-conserving aerators.
- Reduce waste by using recycled content paper, minimizing the use of paper as much as possible, using reusables instead of disposables whenever possible (such as for batteries), and recycling/composting all recyclables and food waste.
- Ensure that all e-waste and hazardous materials are properly recycled and disposed of and not sent to the landfill.

- Operate as a socially and environmentally responsible business with consideration of all of its impacts upon stakeholders.
- Minimize its environmental footprint by conserving resources, minimizing pollution, and reducing waste.

## Scope
