# Hazardous Waste Disposal Policy

It is the policy of Unity Web Agency to:

- Ensure that all e-waste and hazardous materials are properly recycled and disposed of and not sent to the landfill and are in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.
- Collect used batteries/e-waste/other hazardous waste responsibly in properly labeled, sealed, and stored containers within the office and dispose of them at an appropriate waste site or using a waste service.
- Work with landlords/building managers etc. to ensure that hazardous materials are disposed of throughout the facilities being used for business activities.

E-waste and other hazardous office waste include: adhesives, aerosols, anti-freeze, asbestos, batteries, computers, corrosive substances, fertilizers, fluorescent lights, grease, mercury thermometers, paint, pesticides, photo chemicals, poisons, solvents and thinners, toner cartridges, used motor oil.

For hazardous waste (including batteries, toner cartridges, and electronic equipment), a collection bin is located next to the printer in our office suite. Please be sure to place any hazardous waste in this bin, which will be collected monthly.

We recycle batteries and toner cartridges at any [Lowes or Home Depot store](https://www.call2recycle.org/locator/).

Computer electronics and mobile phones will be donated to the [Kramden Institute](https://kramden.org/) which uses the donated items to educate students about computer hardware, refurbish the items, and donate them to those in need. Electronics that are not able to be donated to Kramden must be disposed of at the [Durham Waste Disposal & Recycling Center](https://durhamnc.gov/878/Waste-Disposal-Recycling-Center) or a [Wake County Hazardous Waste Drop Off Facility](http://www.wakegov.com/recycling/recycle/Pages/residentrecycling.aspx).

## Purpose

This policy is adopted so that Unity Web Agency may:

- Operate as a socially and environmentally responsible business with consideration of all of its impacts upon the environment due to electronics and hazardous materials use.
- Minimize its environmental footprint by reducing the amount of hazardous waste sent to landfills and recycling as much as possible.
- Ensure that waste is responsibly managed and disposed of, and is in compliance with any applicable federal, state and local requirements.
