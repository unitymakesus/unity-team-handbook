# Alternative Transit Policy

It is the policy of Unity Web Agency to always encourage all team members and contractors to minimize driving, especially single occupancy vehicle use, and to promote the use of public transit.

Unity Web Agency will:

- Encourage all team members and contractors to minimize driving, especially single occupancy vehicle use
- Provide safe and secure bicycle storage to make it easier for team members to bike to work
- Encourage the use of virtual meeting technology to avoid in-person meetings to the extent possible

## Bike Commuting Logistics

The restrooms in Building 800 at Frontier RTP include showers and lockers that are available for any team members to use.

There are over 20 miles of asphalt pedestrian trails in RTP, which provide a safe and quiet way to commute through RTP.

There are lots of resources for bike commuters on the [GoTriangle website](https://gotriangle.org/biking-walking).

### Bike Durham Bike Buddy

Often, the biggest barrier to commuting by bike is finding a route that feels safe. Bike Durham has a program for cyclists of all experiences called [Bike Buddies](https://bikedurham.org/bikebuddy). This buddy matching system is intended to match new riders with an experienced commuter that lives and/or works near you.

## Public Transit Logistics

The Unity Web Agency office is located at Frontier RTP, which has a bus stop on GoTriangle Route 805.

### GoTriangle

The Research Triangle Park (RTP) has a program called [GoRTP](https://www.rtp.org/local-transit/) and actively works with GoTriangle and other regional partners to provide bus service to the Park. GoTriangle provides regional transit services, as well as last-mile/first-mile connectivity within the Park through its [RTP Connect](https://gotriangle.org/rtpconnect) program. RTP Connect provides a $10 subsidy per trip for an Uber or Lyft trip for team members connecting to or from a public transit route in the Park.

If you are considering a bus commute, you may be eligible for a free $25-value bus pass from GoRTP. Contact [commute@rtp.org](mailto:commute@rtp.org) for more details.

Team members who use alternative forms of transportation in their daily commute can also qualify for awards and incentives through GoTriangle's [GoPerks](https://gotriangle.org/goperks) program.

### Carpool/Vanpool

There are alternatives to driving to the Park on your own. Carpool and vanpool are available and can provide financial savings, minimize stress, and reduce vehicle maintenance.

If you are interested in carpooling, [ShareTheRideNC (STRNC)](https://www.sharetheridenc.org/Public/Home.aspx) is a state and regionally funded resource that connects you with people with similar commute patterns. GoTriangle has also partnered with [Enterprise Rideshare](https://gotriangle.org/rideshare) to provide affordable and effective vanpool service to the Park.

If you are considering a vanpool commute, you may be eligible for a 3-month, $300 capped reimbursement (limited availability). Contact [commute@rtp.org](mailto:commute@rtp.org) for more details.

## Emergency Ride Home

One common concern with commuting via transit or vanpool is the lack of transportation flexibility in case of an emergency. With Emergency Ride Home there is no need to worry about being stranded at the work place during a family emergency, unscheduled overtime, or a ride-sharing driver who canâ€™t shuttle you at your usual time. Emergency Ride Home (ERH) even allows necessary side-trips on the way home, such as picking up a sick child at daycare.

To qualify for Emergency Ride Home, team members must register for the GoTriangle [ERH Program](https://gotriangle.org/erh).

## Purpose
