# Ethical Marketing Policy

It is the policy of Unity Web Agency to always ensure that all marketing related to our products and services meets the highest standards of honesty and integrity.

This policy sets out marketing practices that align with socially and environmentally responsible business practices such as those followed by Certified B Corps.

Unity Web Agency will ensure that all marketing, both online and offline, will:

- Honestly represent Unity Web Agency products and services, without intentionally misleading clients in any way
- Follow best practices for permission-based email marketing by requiring a double opt-in where clients must confirm their email address and their wish to subscribe to the newsletter
- Not share client’s email addresses without their express consent

## Purpose

This Policy is adopted so that Unity Web Agency may operate as a socially and environmentally responsible business with consideration of all of its impacts on stakeholders.

## Scope

## Responsibilities

The CEO and/or the Marketing Manager will be responsible for ensuring that the policy will be followed.


## Implementation

## Program Evaluation

This policy will be reviewed by Unity Web Agency’s Green Team every year. Any changes must be approved by the manager. When the policy is adapted the changes must be shared with active team members & contractors within 30 days of adoption.
