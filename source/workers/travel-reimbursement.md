# Travel Reimbursement Policy

Travel that is required to fulfill a team member's core responsibilities will be considered paid time and the company will reimburse mileage for the direct round trip to and from the destination (if driving).

Examples of travel related to core responsibilities may include (but are not limited to):
- AR/AP: Post office and bank
- Marketing and Sales: Networking events for business development purposes
- Creative Team: Required in-person meetings with clients

This reimbursement does not apply to team activities such as coworking days and volunteer events.

Travel time should be tracked in Hive.

Mileage will be calculated using the most efficient route per Google Maps.

If you're unsure if your travel expenses are eligible for reimbursement, please ask the CEO or COO.
