# Children-at-Work Program

It is the policy of Unity Web Agency to provide a positive work environment that recognizes parents' responsibilities to their job and to their children by acknowledging that, when a child is able to stay with a parent, this benefits the family, the employer, and society.

Our Children-at-Work Program allows parents, upon approval, to bring their children to work with them as long as the parent is successfully able to complete their work tasks, ensure the safety of the child, and maintain minimal disruption of the work environment as a result of the child's presence. This policy applies to infants as well as older children.

## Eligibility

Full-time and part-time team members in good standing with the company are eligible to participate in the program, subject to the specific job responsibilities of the parent and subject to ensuring the safety of the child. Team members currently involved in disciplinary action are not eligible to participate.

## Process

The following forms are required for participation in the program:

- [Individual Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VfFOcm-sfslard8Iu5xGE9vhRE9c05TAWQOhUSqDtxE/edit?usp=sharing), which outlines the specifics of the child's care plan
- [Parent Agreement, Consent & Waiver forms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BYMj966MZ7yiGqrOJ8SUmB0jx70FyW3aBwQRjt321yE/edit?usp=sharing)

The parent will submit all completed and signed forms to the human resources manager (currently Alisa), who will then schedule the Pre-Program Meeting.

Before any child is brought into the workplace, the Pre-Program Meeting must take place between the parent and the human resources manager (currently Alisa). Both parties must review, discuss, and approve the proposed Individual Plan.

## Requirements

- A parent participating in the program may not leave the building (not even for a short time) without taking the child with them.

- The parent will accept complete responsibility for the safety of the child. If the parent's duties require that they leave the office, the parent will take the child with them.

- Each parent shall make their workstation suitable and safe for the child and the child shall be located primarily at that workstation during the work day.

- The parent must provide all supplies and equipment needed to care for the child at the office and ensure that the area is kept in a clean and sanitary condition. All supplies utilized by the parent or child must be maintained in a manner that is not disruptive to the work or physical comfort of other team members.

- Parents are expected to ensure that their children behave responsibly and safely while in the workplace environment. Parents are expected to communicate basic workplace etiquette to their children. A participating parent is responsible for any damage to persons or property caused by the child. If more than accidental damage is caused by the child, Unity may immediately, at its discretion, terminate the child's participation in the program.

- The child should not be permitted to use disable office supplies owned by Unity such as post-it notes or office paper, except as explicitly authorized by a manager. The child may be permitted to occasionally work or play with non-disposable office supplies such as pens, markers, whiteboards, as long as the equipment is not damaged and the child's use of the equipment does not interfere with other team members' work. If office supplies are damaged by the child, the parent will be required to replace those supplies at their own expense. In this event, the child may be prohibited from utilizing any office supplies or equipment in the future, at the discretion of a manager.

- Diapers must be changed only in a designated restroom or in quiet room locations and not in work areas. Used cloth diapers must be stored in a closed container and taken home daily. Used disposable diapers must be wrapped appropriately and discarded in an appropriate contained provided by the parent and placed in an area not used by team members for office or meeting space.

- If a child is fussy, crying, loud, or otherwise disruptive for a prolonged period of time,; causing a significant distraction in the workplace; or preventing the parent from accomplishing required work, the parent shall remove the child from the workplace. The parent will then be charged for time away from work according to Paid Time Off policy or may be subject to pay deductions for missed work.

- Unity will identify one or more locations on the premises that team members may use, if they so choose, while breastfeeding or otherwise feeding their infants or toddlers, as well as a location or locations for changing and disposing of diapers. The location designated for breastfeeding or expressing of milk will be “a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public,” in compliance with Sec. 4207 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

- There may be work circumstances that require a parent's full attention such that it may be necessary for parents to make other arrangements for child care during the utilization of this policy.

- In order for the Children-at-Work Program to be effective, all parties need to be sensitive to the needs of others. The parent must maintain acceptable work performance and ensure that the presence of the child does not create any office disturbances. If problems arise that cannot be resolved, the parent understands that the program may be terminated for that parent.

## Children Performing Company Tasks

At the discretion of their parents, children brought to work under this policy may volunteer to assist with basic tasks on the premises if they wish (such as handing out materials, making copies, etc.). If children wish to participate in work-related activities at Unity, tasks that other employees may suggest for them to complete must first be discussed with the child's parent. No one but the child's parent shall ask the child to complete a work-related task.

Children under 14 years of age must not be asked, even by their parent, to do more than rudimentary, occasional tasks, and no child under 14 years of age shall be required or pressured to do company-related tasks. A child's participation in work-related tasks must be purely voluntary on the park of the child.

If a child more than 14 years of age wishes to assist with more advanced, regular tasks in the workplace, and Unity wishes to employ them, their employment will be governed by [North Carolina's statutes and guidelines](https://www.labor.nc.gov/workplace-rights/youth-employment-rules).

## Illness

A sick child should not be brought to work. If the child becomes sick during the day, the child must be taken home by the parent.

## Other Team Members Caring for Child

Unity understands that other team members may ask the parent for permission to play with or care for the child for brief periods of time. This is acceptable at the discretion of the parent as long as the productivity of the other team member is not substantially reduced.

The child may be in another team member's workspace for brief intervals if requested by the team member and approved by the parent. Consideration must be taken to ensure that the other team member's work environment is safe for the child at all times and that the other team members are not disturbed.

## Complaints

All complaints related to this policy must be made directly to the parent's immediate supervisor or human resources manager, by such means as may be provided. All complains will be kept anonymous to the extent that is possible. The human resources manager shall have final discretion to decide what should be done to resolve the complaint.

## Termination of Eligibility

Unity Web Agency has the right to terminate a parent's participation in the Children-at-Work Program at any time if a parent's performance declines or if organizational needs are not being met (i.e., complaints and/or disruptions to coworkers cannot be resolved).

Eligibility may also be terminated at the sole discretion of the company with written notice to the team member. When eligibility is terminated, the child must be removed from the workplace. Unity will accommodate reasonable time needed for the parent to take the child to an external care arrangement.

## Other

Our Children-at-Work Program is a voluntary option for team members, subject to approval as outlined in this policy, where it is compatible with job requirements.

Other affected team members may request a "child-free" work environment. Such requests should be made through the team member's immediate supervisor. Unity will attempt to accommodate such requests by temporarily relocating the parent or the other team member after discussion with all parties to determine the most effective resolution.

Participation in the Children-at-Work Program is a privilege and not a right.

Unity Web Agency expressly reserves the right to refuse participation in the Program if the requesting parent's position is deemed unsafe or unsuitable for the presence of a child due to business reasons. Unity Web Agency reserves the right to terminate participation in the program to due business conditions.

Unity Web Agency expressly reserves the right to change or reverse this policy. Any changes will be conveyed to affected team members as soon as possible after any change or revision.
