# Disciplinary Process

When regular company training, orientations, coaching, etc. is not sufficient to prevent unwanted behavior or improve performance, it is the policy of Unity Web Agency to have a transparent and progressive disciplinary policy. This policy is enacted to address team member workplace behavior that does not meet the company code of conduct/performance standards that have been communicated to team members.

Unity Web Agency will:

- Communicate a clear code of conduct/set of standards/performance expectations to team members (in orientations, trainings, bulletins, etc.).
- Employ performance reviews, onboarding orientations, and training programs to prevent behaviors from occurring in the first place and fostering a transparent, respectful, and collaborative work environment.
- Whenever appropriate, take a progressive approach to disciplinary action, which may include verbal recognition of the issue, a written warning, a probationary period, and/or termination. We reserve the right to forgo/eliminate any of these steps in the event of an egregious issue.
- Example infractions or issues that may be subject to the disciplinary policy include:
    - Discrimination
    - Confrontational behavior impacting daily work flow
    - Inadequate performance based on job description
    - Improper use of company time
    - Sexual harassment
    - Social media misuse
    - Theft of company property

## Purpose

This policy is adopted so that Unity Web Agency may:

- Address work-related behavior issues acknowledging that team members make mistakes and have ability to grow and improve, while honoring the harm that is done by some infringements.
- Support all team members in their right to a safe workplace and fair treatment.
- Increase transparency, consistency, and accountability for all team members.
- Improve communication between team members and managers.

This policy sets out team member disciplinary practices that align with socially and environmentally responsible business practices such as those followed by Certified B Corps.

## Scope

This policy shall apply to all full-time and part-time team members.

## Responsibilities

The CEO will be responsible for providing this policy to all team members and for providing ongoing support as needed.

HR will be responsible for providing support and collaborating with managers as needed.

Direct managers/supervisors will be responsible for carrying out and documenting disciplinary actions, communicating with the team member, and collaborating with HR as needed.

All team members and contractors will be responsible for following this policy and contacting the CEO with any questions or concerns.

## Implementation

Unity Web Agency will distribute this policy to all team members upon hiring. In cases where the policy is adopted after a team member has been hired, the policy will be shared with the team member within 30 days of adoption.

## Program Evaluation

Unity Web Agency will check in with team member(s), managers, and HR on a regular basis, at least annually as part of a review process, to ensure that this policy is being followed and improved upon as needed.

It is incumbent upon each team member, regardless of level or category, to perform in an exemplary manner reflecting their job description, operating procedures, laws and regulations, code of conduct, and principles of Unity Web Agency.
