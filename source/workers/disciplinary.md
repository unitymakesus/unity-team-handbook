# Disciplinary Process

When regular company training, orientations, coaching, etc. is not sufficient to prevent unwanted behavior or improve performance, it is the policy of Unity Web Agency to have a transparent and progressive disciplinary policy. This policy is enacted to address team member workplace behavior that does not meet the company code of conduct/performance standards that have been communicated to team members.

Unity Web Agency will:

- Communicate a clear code of conduct/set of standards/performance expectations to team members (in orientations, trainings, bulletins, etc.).
- Employ performance reviews, onboarding orientations, and training programs to prevent behaviors from occurring in the first place and fostering a transparent, respectful, and collaborative work environment.
- Provide written guidance on the disciplinary policy to team members, including which types of infractions will result in which level of beginning disciplinary action (including which may result in immediate termination).
