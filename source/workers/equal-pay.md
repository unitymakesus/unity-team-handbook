# Equal Pay Policy

All permanent team members are paid the same salary of $57,100 per year or the hourly equivalent of $27.62. We created this policy to eliminate the historical pay inequities in the tech industry due to role, gender, race, ethnicity, age, and sexual orientation.

It is the policy of Unity Web Agency to pay team members and raise wages based on the cost of living and company success. Our leadership team meets every 3 months to review company performance and to set upcoming goals.

## Part-Time vs Full-Time Employment

- Full-time paid team members work year-round and typically work 35-50 hours per week.
- Part-time paid team members work year-round but do not meet full-time equivalency standards (typically less than 35 hours per week).
- Temporary team members are defined as seasonal and contract workers.

## Payment

Unity Web Agency pays all team members on a monthly basis via direct deposit. Paychecks are deposited in team members' bank accounts on the 10th day of the month following the month of service.

## Living Wage

We believe that all workers need a living wage, which is defined as the amount of income needed for an individual or family to meet basic needs such as housing, food, and transportation without public or private assistance. Unity Web Agency is a member of the [Durham Living Wage Project](https://www.durhamlivingwageproject.org/).
