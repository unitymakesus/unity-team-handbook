# Equal Pay Policy

All permanent team members are paid the same salary of $57,100 per year or the hourly equivalent of $27.62. We created this policy to eliminate the historical pay inequities in the tech industry due to role, gender, race, ethnicity, age, and sexual orientation.

As a team, we can increase the pay for all by meeting company goals and objectives. Our leadership team meets every 3 months to review company performance and to set upcoming goals.
