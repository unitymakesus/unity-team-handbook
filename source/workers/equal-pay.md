# Equal Pay Policy

All permanent team members are paid the same salary of $60,000 per year or the hourly equivalent of $29.02. We created this policy to eliminate the historical pay inequities in the tech industry due to role, gender, race, ethnicity, age, and sexual orientation.

It is the policy of Unity Web Agency to pay team members and raise wages based on the cost of living and company success. Our leadership team meets every 3 months to review company performance and to set upcoming goals.

## Part-Time vs Full-Time Employment

- Full-time paid team members work year-round and typically work 35-50 hours per week.
- Part-time paid team members work year-round but do not meet full-time equivalency standards (typically less than 35 hours per week).
- Temporary team members are defined as seasonal and contract workers.

## Payment

Unity Web Agency pays all team members on a monthly basis via direct deposit. Paychecks are deposited in team members' bank accounts on the 10th day of the month following the month of service.

## Living Wage

We believe that all workers need a living wage, which is defined as the amount of income needed for an individual or family to meet basic needs such as housing, food, and transportation without public or private assistance. Unity Web Agency is a member of the [Durham Living Wage Project](https://www.durhamlivingwageproject.org/).

## Bonuses

Full-time and part-time employees are eligible for an annual bonus. Bonuses will be paid out in December of each year that the company meets its financial goals. The bonus may not be available in any given year, based upon the CEO's discretion if the company finances do not allow for it.

## Responsibilities

Unity Web Agency will be responsible for providing this policy to all team members and contractor workers and for providing ongoing support as needed.

HR and management will be responsible for reviewing wages on a regular basis, conducting performance reviews, and documenting all pay related decision making and activity.

All team members and contractors will be responsible for following this policy and contacting management with any questions or concerns.

## Implementation

Unity Web Agency will distribute this policy to all team members and contract workers upon hiring. In cases where the policy is adopted after a team member has been hired, the policy will be shared with the team member within 30 days of adoption.

## Program Evaluation

Unity Web Agency will check in with all team members and contractors on a regular basis, at least annually as part of a review process, to ensure that this policy is being followed and that team members are being supported through fair wage policies.
