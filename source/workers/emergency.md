Please have a co-worker meet the paramedics and Management at the entrance to the building to escort them to the location of the person in need.

## Civil Disturbances

Upon receiving notification that a civil disturbance threatens Frontier RTP or its occupants, call 911 and advise the Durham Police Department of the situation. Be sure to use Frontier RTP's address, 800 Park Office Drive, when speaking with the 911 operator.

Immediately after you have contacted the Durham Police Department, contact Frontier RTP Management. For the protection of personnel and company assets, tenants should:

- Stay out of the main corridors of the building.
- Stay away from outside windows.
- Lock all doors except your main entrance door.
- Notify all team members and visitors about the civil disturbance and warn them to avoid personal contact with the demonstrators; do not make any comments or statements to anger the demonstrators.
- Ask all team members and visitors to avoid leaving the building.
- If demonstrators penetrate your building, warn team members and visitors to be on alert for "unattended” and "suspicious" items that were carried in by the demonstrators (i.e. clothing, knapsacks, bags, etc.). Additionally, warn them not to touch, move, disturb, or cover any suspicious items that are left. If any suspicious items are discovered, contact Frontier RTP Management immediately and follow the procedure outlined in the Bomb Threat section.

## Bomb Threats
It has been clearly proven that the vast majority of these calls are indeed false alarms, meant only to disturb the normal work of a person or company. However, at no time should any call be regarded as a false alarm. When a call is received, please follow the guide below:

- Keep the caller on the line as long as possible.
- If possible, signal a co-worker to dial 911. Tell the 911 operator to have the call traced. Be sure to use Frontier RTP's address, 800 Park Office Drive, when speaking with the 911 operator.
- Obtain and document as much information from the caller as possible.
    - Time bomb is to explode.
    - Location of bomb.
    - Description of bomb.
    - Time call is received.
    - If possible, write down exact wording used by caller.
    - Voice of caller (male, female, dialect, etc.).
    - Reason for threat.
    - Background noise.
- After the caller has hung up, contact Frontier RTP Management immediately to report the threat.

- Management will make a complete search of the suspected area. If a suspicious item is identified, the Durham Police Department will then investigate the object.

- The decision to evacuate is ordinarily left to the tenant unless physical evidence of a bomb is found.

- If you determine that your team members and visitors are in imminent danger and you cannot reach Frontier RTP Management within a reasonable length of time -- you may determine it prudent to exercise your independent judgment and move or evacuate your personnel without being given specific instructions to follow.

- Should the building or another tenant receive a bomb threat, you will be advised and informed of any specific details. You may then decide whether you will evacuate.

## Other Emergencies

### Tornadoes or Severe Weather

In most cases, advance warning in the event of a tornado or severe weather is not likely. Therefore, if a tornado or severe weather is approaching Frontier RTP, immediately notify Frontier RTP Management. Management will monitor the weather and tune into local news cast for additional information. If conditions warrant, Management will notify tenants that severe weather is in the area in order for tenants to begin moving into the core areas of the building (i.e., corridors, restrooms, etc.) and take cover.

Whenever possible, do not enter the lobby or leave the building. The greatest danger will be that of flying glass and objects; therefore, attempt to relocate where the maximum numbers of walls are between you and the exterior of the building. Once weather conditions improve, Management will notify tenants of the “all clear”.

### Power Failure or Flooding

In the event of a power failure or flooding, the closing of Frontier RTP may be recommended, depending on the severity of the problem. Frontier RTP is equipped with backup generators that will provide emergency lighting so tenants can exit the buildings. If evacuation is necessary, tenants will be given instructions via email.

### Other Safety Hazards

Please contact Frontier RTP Management immediately when any of the following occur:
- Storm damage
- Water leaks
- Odor or other evidence of escaping natural gas or chemicals
- Smoke
- Explosion
- Theft/vandalism
- Accident
- Glass breakage
- Any situation that you feel poses a threat to the safety of Frontier RTP or its occupants
