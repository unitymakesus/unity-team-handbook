# Career Development and Internal Hiring Policy

It is the policy of Unity Web Agency to provide opportunities for existing team members to receive consideration and preference for new job openings within the company, to support team members who wish to make lateral moves or change career direction/pace when possible, and to make an effort to find a place for team members who seek to take a long-term leave or sabbatical upon their return.

Unity Web Agency will:

- Inform all current team members about new job openings regardless of current role
- Provide information upon request about the hiring process for new openings
- Consider all applications equally
- Determine whether an internal candidate has the skills to perform the job
- Examine recent performance evaluations in assessing a candidate's ability to perform the job
- Proceed with the standard hiring process, including an interview for qualified candidates
- Notify team members about the final hiring decision
- Communicate with team members prior to going on long-term leave or sabbatical about possible options for their return
- Offer any available position(s) to returning team members and/or work with them to create an opportunity if possible
- Make an effort to support team members who express interest in making a lateral move within the company

## Purpose

This policy is adopted so that Unity Web Agency may:

- Operate as a socially and environmentally responsible business with consideration of all of its impacts upon stakeholders.
- Support all team members in career development and opportunities
- Increase retention of team members by offering opportunities for growth and change when desired
- Increase retention of team members by allowing them to take long-term leave or sabbatical with an opportunity to return to work

This policy sets out professional development practices that align with socially and environmentally responsible business practices such as those followed by Certified B Corps.

## Scope

This policy shall apply to all full-time team members, part-time team members, and contract workers. Team members may be promoted only after their onboarding period ends and if they are not under a performance improvement plan.

## Responsibilities

The CEO will be responsible for notifying team members of open positions and supervising the hiring process as specified above.

The Human Resources Department or Hiring Manager will be responsible for ensuring that those who wish to return to work after long-term leave or sabbatical or move positions within the company are given an opportunity to do so if possible.

## Implementation

Unity Web Agency will distribute this policy to all team members and contract workers upon hiring. In cases where the policy is adopted after a team member has been hired, the policy will be shared with the team member within 30 days of adoption.

The team members and contractors will be responsible for ensuring that all of the recommended practices will be followed.

New job openings will be shared with team members, including a description of the position with salary grade, required qualifications, and the date by which the applications are due.

## Program Evaluation

Unity Web Agency will check in with all team members and contractors on a regular basis, at least annually as part of a review process, to ensure that this policy is being followed and that team members are taking advantage of professional development opportunities.
