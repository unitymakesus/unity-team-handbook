# Breastfeeding Policy

In recognition of the well-documented health advantages of breastfeeding for infants and parents, Unity Web Agency provides a supportive environment to enable breastfeeding parents to express their milk during work hours.

Unity Web Agency will:

- Abide by any local, state, or federal regulations regarding breastfeeding
- Allow new parents to take time off at work as needed to breastfeed or pump milk
- Designate a private room that may be used for breastfeeding or pumping milk

## Scope

This policy shall apply to all full-time, part-time, and contract team members.

## Company Responsibilities

Breastfeeding parents who choose to continue providing milk for their infants after returning to work shall receive:

- __Milk Expression Breaks:__ Breastfeeding parents are allowed to breastfeed or express milk during work hours using their normal breaks and meal times. For time that may be needed beyond the usual break times, team members may use personal leave or may make up the time as negotiated with their supervisors.

- __A Place to Express Milk:__ Suite 3313 is available for team members to breastfeed or express milk. The room is private and sanitary, located near a sink with running water for washing hands and rinsing out breast pump parts, and as an electrical outlet. Expressed milk may be stored in a closed and labeled container in the Unity Web Agency refrigerator or team member's personal cooler.

- __Team Support:__ Supervisors are responsible for alerting pregnant and breastfeeding team members about the company's breastfeeding support program, and for negotiating policies and practices that will help facilitate each team member's infant feeding goals. It is expected that all team members will assist in providing a positive atmosphere of support for breastfeeding team members.

## Team Member Responsibilities

- __Communication with Supervisors:__ Team members who wish to express milk during the work period shall keep supervisors informed of their needs so that appropriate accommodations can be made to satisfy the needs of both the team member and the company.

- __Maintenance of Milk Expression Areas:__ Breastfeeding team members are responsible for keeping milk expression areas clean for the next user. The responsibilities extend to both designated milk expression areas, as well as other areas where expressing milk will occur.

- __Milk Storage:__ Team members should label all milk expressed with their name and date collected so it is not inadvertently confused with another team member's milk. Each team member is responsible for proper storage of their own milk.

- __Use of Break Times to Express Milk:__ When more than one breastfeeding parent needs to use the designated lactation room, team members can negotiate milk expression times that are most convenient or best meet their needs.
