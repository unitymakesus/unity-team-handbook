# Open Book Management Policy

Unity Web Agency operates using an Open Book Management approach. This approach has been adopted in order to empower team members to make decisions that will help the company to increase its profitability as well as to strengthen the company's overall management and operations.

This allows team members to:

- Review the income and balance sheet for the company
- Understand how the company's financials are managed
- Learn how to understand the company's financial reports and practices
