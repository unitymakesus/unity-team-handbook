# Guns Policy

A concealed handgun permit does not authorize a person to carry a concealed handgun on the property. The carrying of a concealed or unconcealed weapon at Frontier RTP by anyone other than a sworn law enforcement officer in the performance of official duties is prohibited. This policy is made in accordance with North Carolina General Statutes 14-415.11. Frontier RTP includes all buildings in the complex, as well as walkways, common areas, and parking lots.
