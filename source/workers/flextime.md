# Flextime Policy

Unity Web Agency is committed to helping team members face the demands of juggling work, family, and life-related issues by offering a number of possible flexible work arrangements. These arrangements provide team members with increased flexibility with their work schedule while allowing Unity Web Agency to maintain a progressive and productive work environment. Alternative work scheduling is an opportunity to maintain team member productivity through various forms of creative work scheduling.

All Unity Web Agency team members will be considered for alternative work scheduling on a case-by-case basis in situations where creative work schedules have been shown to accomplish both work and personal goals, to provide coverage for individual department operations and to serve Unity Web Agency as a whole with increased productivity at no expense to quality output.

Several alternative work schedule options are available to team members:

- __Flextime__, in which a team member works eight hours per workday, but there is flexibility in a team member's set scheduled starting and ending times. Some team members, due to family or personal obligations or preferences, work very early in the morning and leave earlier in the afternoon. Other flextime team members may prefer or need to start later in the day and work into the evening.
- __10-hour day, four-day workweek__, in which a team member works 10 hours per workday, reducing the workweek to four days a week.
- __Nine-hour day, half-day on Friday__, in which a team member works nine-hour workdays Monday through Thursday and four hours each Friday.

The department manager is responsible for identifying if any of the aforementioned flextime options are workable within the department. This may include determining if the entire department or an entire shift must convert to one or more of the above alternative scheduling options. To determine whether a team member's request for an individual alternative work schedule is appropriate, the manager must assess the impact and the outcome in terms of production, quality and absenteeism, and if one or a combination of the above arrangements is in the best interests of the department, Unity Web Agency, and team member.

Types of flexible work arrangements and potential schedules must be approved with consent of the HR department prior to announcement and implementation.

There will be a three-month trial period to assess the impact of the flexible work arrangement. After successful completion of the trial period, the work arrangement will be reviewed at least annually thereafter to ensure continued success. The arrangement may be canceled for any reason by management. A team member wishing to change or cancel an alternative work arrangement must obtain written approval from his or her manager with consent from HR.

## Scope

Flexible work arrangements are not appropriate for all team members or positions and are not a universal team member benefit. The following conditions must be met for a flexible work schedule to be approved: The team member must have a satisfactory attendance record, meet all performance expectations in his or her current role, and consistently demonstrate the ability to complete tasks and assignments on a timely basis. The nature of the team member's work and responsibilities must be conducive to a flexible work arrangement without causing significant disruption to performance and/or service delivery.

Human resources has the general responsibility of overseeing the day-to-day implementation of this policy in accordance with payroll and legal requirements. Any requests for exceptions to this policy should be made in writing to the HR department for review and approval. Only HR, or their designee, in consultation with the CEO and the affected department manager, may grant such an exception.
