# Bereavement Leave Policy

Unity Web Agency's bereavement policy outlines our provisions for team members who lose a loved one. If this happens, we want to support our team members and allow them time to mourn and cope.

When a death occurs in a team member's immediate family, we'll offer the typical bereavement leave of three (3) days days off with pay. The pay for time off will be pro-rated for part-time team members. We will grant this bereavement time off for the following reasons:

- Arrangement of a funeral or memorial service
- Attendance of a funeral or memorial service
- Resolving matters of inheritance
- Fulfillment of family obligations
- Personal mourning

## Additional Bereavement Time Off

Unity understands the deep impact that death can have on an individual or a family, therefore additional time off may be granted. This additional time off will be unpaid unless a team member chooses to supplement the bereavement days off with accrued PTO.

Individual team member circumstances may be discussed with the team member's manager and Human Resources to determine whether additional considerations are needed. It is Unity's intention to support team members during their times of grief and bereavement.

## Scope

### Eligibility

This sick leave policy applies to full- or part-time (20 hours per week or more) regular team members who have been with the company for at least 3 months. Temporary, contract, or intermittent team members and interns are not eligible for paid leave, but may qualify for unpaid leave.

### What is considered immediate family for bereavement leave?

In this policy, we define immediate family as spouses or domestic partners, all first degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children &mdash; including half, step, adopted, and fostered), grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, first cousins, nieces, and nephews. In-laws of the same types are included.

Friends are also an important part of our lives and their loss may hurt as much as losing a relative. Should you lose a close friend, you’re still entitled to the same amount of bereavement leave to attend the funeral and mourn.

## Process

If you need to take bereavement leave, please inform your manager and HR as soon as possible. You can do this via email, phone, or Hive.

After speaking with your manager, requests for Bereavement Leave should be submitted through [Hrvey](https://www.hrvey.com/dashboard).

The following guidelines should be used when requesting time off:

- Please select "Paid Leave" and enter "Bereavement Leave" in the notes field.

Normally, we don’t require proof of death. However Unity may, in unusual circumstances, require verification of the need for the bereavement leave.

## Responsibilities

Managers must adhere to policy regulations and be supportive of team member bereavement during difficult times. Managers may face disciplinary action if the situations are not handled appropriately (e.g. refusing to approve bereavement leave).
