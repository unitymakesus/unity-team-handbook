# Resignation Policy

Although Unity Web Agency hopes that employment with the company will be a mutually rewarding experience, it is understood that varying circumstances do cause team members to voluntarily resign. Should this time come, team members are asked to follow the guidelines below regarding notice and exit procedures.

## Purpose

This policy is adopted so that Unity Web Agency may:

- Support a smooth transition for the exiting team member
- Facilitate knowledge transfer for roles and responsibilities that belong to the exiting team member
- Begin seeking a new hire or reallocate job tasks amongst remaining team members

This policy sets out practices that align with socially and environmentally responsible business practices such as those followed by Certified B Corps.

## Scope

This policy shall apply to all full-time, part-time, and contract team members.

## Process

### Considering resigning?

Team members who wish to discuss concerns about their continued employment before making a final decision to resign are encouraged to do so. Team members may request a meeting with their supervisor or CEO for this conversation.

### Notice of resignation

Tell your supervisor first. When speaking with your supervisor, let them know your proposed last day. Follow up with a notice in writing via email to your supervisor.

Team members are encouraged to provide the maximum possible amount of notice to facilitate a smooth transition out of the organization and to allow time for a replacement to be hired. At a minimum, Unity Web Agency will need two weeks' notice, but would appreciate knowing well in advance of that.

### Exit meeting

Exiting team members will be scheduled for an exit meeting to provide an opportunity to discuss any questions or concerns related to their time with Unity Web Agency.

### Exit procedures

Before leaving, exiting team members are expected to:

- Completing work as assigned until the end of their last day
- Provide access to any files that other team members may need after you leave
- Return any company property that was loaned to you (books, keys, office furniture, equipment, etc).
- Confirm your forwarding address to ensure that benefits and tax information are received in a timely manner.

### Final pay

Final pay will be delivered by the next payday unless state law or other procedures dictate otherwise. Accrued but unused PTO will be paid out consistent with the PTO policy and state law requirements.

### Eligibility for rehire

Team members who resign in good standing under the team policies may be eligible for reemployment. Former team members who apply for open positions will be considered along with all other candidates.

## Responsibilities

HR will be responsible for providing this policy to all team members and for providing ongoing support as needed.

All team members and contractors will be responsible for following this policy and contacting the CEO with any questions or concerns.

## Implementation

Unity Web Agency will distribute this policy to all team members upon hiring. In cases where the policy is adopted after a team member has been hired, the policy will be shared with the team member within 30 days of adoption.

## Program Evaluation

Unity Web Agency will check in with team member(s) on a regular basis, at least annually as part of a review process, to ensure that this policy is being followed.
