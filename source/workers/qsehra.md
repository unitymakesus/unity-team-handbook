# Healthcare Reimbursement Policy

Unity has adopted a Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA), which provides health coverage benefits through reimbursement of premiums for qualified health insurance coverage and eligible medical expenses.

Some examples of eligible expenses are out of pocket expenses for you, your spouse, or tax dependents, which may include:

- Copays for primary care and specialists
- Prescription medications
- Over-the-counter medications
- Dental work
- Eye glasses or contact lenses
- Lab work

Please see [IRS Publication 502](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf) for a full summary of eligible expenses.

## Eligibility

This QSEHRA policy applies to full- or part-time (20 hours per week or more) regular team members who have been with the company for at least 3 months. Temporary, contract, or intermittent team members and interns are not eligible for this benefit.

Additionally, team members must have Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) as [defined by the IRA](https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/individuals-and-families/aca-individual-shared-responsibility-provision-minimum-essential-coverage) and be 25 years of age or older to participate in the QSEHRA.

Eligible team members may request reimbursement for qualified expenses incurred by themselves, their spouse, or dependent, as long as the person who incurred the expenses is covered by MEC.

## Accrual

Eligible team members will accrue __$441.67__ per month to reimburse health insurance premiums and eligible medical expenses.

A QSEHRA is a health reimbursement arrangement, so there is not an "account." All reimbursements given through the QSEHRA are funded by Unity.

Please see the Frequently Asked Questions below for more information.

## Process

Unity uses [Take Command Health](https://takecommandhealth.com) as our QSEHRA facilitator. At the beginning of each year (or when you initially become eligible), you will need to log onto the [member portal](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal) and provide proof of qualifying health insurance (such as a member ID card, insurance bill, etc.).

You may then submit reimbursement requests to Take Command Health through the member portal. Requests for reimbursement must be submitted by March 31st following the year in which the expense was incurred.

Unity will receive reports from Take Command Health that indicate how much to reimburse you. __These reports will contain only your reimbursement amount and will not contain any confidential protected health information.__ You will receive reimbursements directly through your paycheck.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are my QSEHRA benefits taxable?

Most reimbursements received through the QSRHRA are not taxed. However, reimbursements for premiums paid pre-tax, such as a spouse's employer's group plan, are taxable and are included as income.

### I already have an HSA. How does my QSEHRA affect my HSA?

While you can keep your HSA and the balance in it, because your QSEHRA allows reimbursements for medical expenses, you cannot continue to contribute funds to your HSA. Once you are no longer eligible for a QSEHRA, you can begin contributing to your HSA again.

You can also continue to use your HSA, but if you use your HSA to pay for a medical expense, you may not also request reimbursement for the same expense through the QSEHRA.

### What if my premium is less than the reimbursement amount? Can I use the remaining balance for other health expenses?

If the reimbursement offered is more than your premium, the unused portion of the reimbursement will accrue throughout the year and can be applied towards eligible medical expenses.

### What happens if I have money left over or I have unreimbursed expenses at the end of the year?

Any offered amount that has not been claimed as a reimbursement is carried over at the end of the year and may be used for expenses incurred in the new year. You may use any remaining amount from the previous year to reimburse expenses that were incurred during the previous year, but each year's expenses must be submitted by March 31st of the following year. Unity and Take Command Health are not responsible if you do not submit your expenses within that timeframe. If you do not have enough available balance from the previous year to cover expenses incurred during the previous year, you may use your available balance from the new year as long as you request reimbursement for the previous year expenses by March 31st of the new year.

### What happens to the money in my QSEHRA if my employment is terminated?

If you had an unused QSEHRA balance, you will have 90 days to request reimbursement for health insurance premiums and eligible medical expenses that were incurred while you were an eligible team member. Any individually purchased health insurance plan you have will not be affected.
