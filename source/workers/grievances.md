# Grievances Policy

Unity Web Agency is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and welcoming environment for all team members. Any team member who has a complaint, problem, or concern should discuss it immediately with his or her supervisor. Supervisors are required to address concerns immediately and seek solutions as appropriate.

If a team member has a complaint, problem, or concern regarding their direct supervisor, the team member should discuss it with the CEO.
