# Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy

Eligible team members are entitled to accrue PTO at the rate of 1 hour of PTO for each 17.333 hours in a pay period. This equates to 15 PTO days for full-time team members. PTO is separate from other types of leave like Holidays or Sick and Safe Leave.

## Eligibility

This paid time off policy applies to full- or part-time (20 hours per week or more) regular team members who have been with the company for at least 3 months. Temporary, contract, or intermittent team members and interns are not eligible for this benefit.

## Accrual

Team members begin to accrue leave under this policy at the start of employment and can use leave anytime thereafter. Full-time team members accrue __10__ hours of PTO in each month, regardless of holidays or paid time off. Likewise, part-time team members accrue one hour of PTO for each __17.333__ hours in a pay period, including any holidays, paid time off, or overtime.

Unused PTO under this policy carries over at the end of each calendar year. Full-time team members may carry over up to __210__ hours. Part-time team members may carry over up to __105__ hours.

Unused PTO is eligible to be paid out at the end of employment, based on certain conditions. Team members who leave voluntarily, are laid off, or let go due to performance reasons will receive a cash payout of unused PTO. However, team members who are let go due to a violation of company policies forfeit this benefit and will not receive a cash payout of unused PTO.

## Process

Requests for time off should be submitted through [Hrvey](https://www.hrvey.com/dashboard).

The following guidelines should be used when requesting time off:

- For 1 or fewer days of PTO: 1 week notice
- For 2-4 days of PTO: 1 month notice
- For 5+ days of PTO: 3 months notice

Note: If a team member requests time off within the same week, it will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

Once time off has been approved, please block the time in your calendar by adding an event called "Name Out" (e.g. "Alisa Out").
