# Remote Work / Work From Home (WFH) Policy

Due to COVID-19, our office is closed. All team members are required to work remotely unless a circumstance occurs when working from the office is necessary (such as a power outage or similar incident at home).

## Otherwise:

All team members are granted one day a week of WFH unless otherwise arranged. Any other arrangements must be pre-approved at least 1 week in advance. When working from home:

- The team member must add to the calendar "Name WFH."
- The team member must be responsive within a 30 minute window unless otherwise arranged.
- The team member must have access to the internet and everything they need to complete their work.

If these protocols are not followed, the team member may be subject to disciplinary action or lose their remote work privileges.
