# B Corporation

Unity Web Agency is part of the global community of [Certified B Corporations](https://bcorporation.net/about-b-corps) who meet the highest standards of verified, overall social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability.

All Certified B Corporations agree to the Declaration of Interdependence.

## Declaration of Interdependence

We envision a global economy that uses business as a force for good.

This economy is comprised of a new type of corporation – the B Corporation – which is purpose-driven and creates benefit for all stakeholders, not just shareholders.

As B Corporations and leaders of this emerging economy, we believe:

- That we must be the change we seek in the world.
- That all business ought to be conducted as if people and place mattered.
- That, through their products, practices, and profits, businesses should aspire to do no harm and benefit all.
- To do so requires that we act with the understanding that we are each dependent upon another and thus responsible for each other and future generations.
