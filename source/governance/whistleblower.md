* Thoroughly investigate the allegations to determine whether the actions occurred as a result of a mistake or were done with intent to deceive
* Provide training or remediation as necessary if the inappropriate conduct was the result of a mistake due to lack of training or awareness
* Take appropriate action if the conduct was intentional, including but not limited to verbal and/or written warnings or termination from the company
