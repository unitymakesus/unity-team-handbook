# Mission

Our mission is to make the internet radically inclusive by creating accessible and sustainable websites that follow WCAG standards with a minimal environmental impact.

People with disabilities are a historically marginalized group of internet users. We create websites that are designed from the beginning to provide equal access to all people regardless of (dis)ability.

Additionally, the internet as a whole produces roughly the same emissions as global aviation travel. We build websites in such a way as to improve their energy efficiency and host websites using green energy sources.

## Our Values

* Serve the greater good
* Create with wonder
* Lead with joy
* Embrace differences
* Cultivate harmony
