# Mission

Our mission is to make the internet radically inclusive by creating websites that follow WCAG standards, providing access to all people regardless of (dis)ability.

People with disabilities are a historically marginalized group of internet users. We create websites that are designed from the beginning to provide equal access to all.

## Our Values

* Serve the greater good
* Create with wonder
* Lead with joy
* Embrace differences
* Cultivate harmony
