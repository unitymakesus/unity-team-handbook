# Anti-Harassment Policy

We are committed in all areas to providing a work environment that is free from harassment. Harassment based upon an individual’s gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability or any other legally protected characteristics will not be tolerated. All team members, including supervisors and other management personnel, are expected and required to abide by this policy. No person will be adversely affected in employment with our organization as a result of bringing complaints of unlawful harassment.

Sexual harassment is behavior of a sexual nature that is unwelcome and offensive to the person or persons it is targeted toward. Examples of harassing behavior may include unwanted physical contact, foul language of an offensive sexual nature, sexual propositions, sexual jokes or remarks, obscene gestures, and displays of pornographic or sexually explicit pictures, drawings, or caricatures. Use of our computer system for the purpose of viewing, displaying, or disseminating material that is sexual in nature may also constitute harassing behavior.

If a team member feels that he or she has been harassed on the basis of their gender, sexual orientation, race, national origin, ethnic background, disability, or any other legally protected characteristic they should immediately report the matter to their supervisor. If that person is not available, or if the team member feels it would be unproductive to inform that person, the team member should immediately contact that supervisor’s superior or human resources. Once the matter has been reported it will be promptly investigated and any necessary corrective action will be taken where appropriate. All complaints of unlawful harassment will be handled in as discreet and confidential a manner as is possible under the circumstances. The procedure for reporting incidents of harassing behavior is not intended to impair, replace, or limit the right of any team member to seek a remedy under available state or federal law by immediately reporting the matter to the appropriate state or federal agency.

Any team member engaging in improper harassing behavior will be subject to disciplinary action, including the possible termination of employment.
